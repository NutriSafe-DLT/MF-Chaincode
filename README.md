# Chain Code #

The MetaHL Fabric Chain Code implements a data/asset management for your blockchain. It originates from the [NutriSafe](https://nutrisafe.de/ "NutriSafe") research project and is part of its official toolkit. You can read, write, update, create and delete objects in the blockchain network with simple commands and even define new object types (so called meta objects). Combined with the [MetaHL Fabric REST API](https://github.com/OTARIS/MF-REST-API/ "MetaHL Fabric REST API"), different roles from different use cases of an organization can be mapped to users with customizable access rights via the REST API for all chaincode functions.

Possible use cases include, but are not limited to:
* read access for the company's management dashboard
* automatic creation of new virtual products by supported machines (after physically creating a product)
* manual updates of product attributes by certified laboratories
* tracing product origins on the underlying supply chains

## Features ##

We continuously work on and extend the Chain Code. Combined with the [MetaHL Fabric REST API](https://github.com/OTARIS/MF-REST-API/ "MetaHL Fabric REST API") the following incomplete feature list might give you at least an idea about the capabilities:
* creating, deleting, updating and reading objects from the chain
* definition of new object types and possible attributes (meta objects)
* user management with roles and user assignable whitelists for restricting chaincode calls
* authentication with bruteforce force protection
* filtered selection of object IDs

## Installation ##

Before you install the chain code make sure your network is set up. 

We recommend to start with the startNetwork.sh script for fabric-version2x of the [NutriSafe network tools](https://github.com/NutriSafe-DLT/nutrisafe/ "NutriSafe Network").

      cd fabric-version2x/
      ./startNetwork.sh

For an easy installation of the chain code, you only need to copy the MetaHL Fabric Chain Code sources into the chaincode folder and run the installCC.sh script.

      cd chaincode/
      git clone https://github.com/OTARIS/MF-Chaincode/ MF-Chain-Code
      cd ..
      ./installCC.sh -c MF-Chain-Code

For easy use to the chain code, do not forget to check out the [MetaHL Fabric REST API](https://github.com/OTARIS/MF-REST-API/ "MetaHL Fabric REST API") repo!
